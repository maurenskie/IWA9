Here are the changes I made:

I added a semicolon to the end of each statement, for consistency and to avoid potential issues with automatic semicolon insertion.
I changed tax.913 to tax['913'], since property names in objects are strings, and numeric keys can't be accessed with the dot notation.
I parsed the tax rate as a decimal using parseFloat() and divided it by 100 to get the decimal rate.
I calculated the taxable amount by multiplying the salary by the decimal tax rate.
I calculated the after-tax amount by subtracting the taxable amount from the salary.
I interpolated the lodging and size variables to create the rent key, which I used to look up the rent amount in the rent object.
I subtracted all expenses from the after-tax amount and rounded the final result to two decimal places using toFixed(2).
This should log the expected result of 2658.05.
